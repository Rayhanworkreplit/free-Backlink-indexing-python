# Railway Deployment Guide - Free Ping Indexer Pro

## Step-by-Step Deployment Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your GitHub Repository

1. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   - Create a new GitHub repository
   - Push all your project files to the repository
   - Make sure all files are committed and pushed

### Step 2: Sign up for Railway

1. **Go to Railway.app:**
   - Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Click "Start a New Project"

2. **Connect Your GitHub Account:**
   - Click "Login with GitHub"
   - Authorize Railway to access your GitHub repositories
   - This helps with account verification for the full trial

3. **Account Verification Status:**
   - **Full Trial**: If your GitHub account is verified, you can deploy code + databases
   - **Limited Trial**: If not verified, you can only deploy databases
   - **$5 Credit**: New users get $5 free credit to test the platform

### Step 3: Create a New Railway Project

1. **Select Deployment Method:**
   - Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your Free Ping Indexer Pro repository
   - Railway will automatically detect it's a Python/Flask project

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Railway will need these environment variables:
   ```
   SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
   FLASK_ENV=production
   PYTHONPATH=/app
   ```

### Step 4: Railway Auto-Deployment

Railway will automatically:
- ✅ Detect Python 3.11 from `runtime.txt`
- ✅ Install dependencies from `pyproject.toml`
- ✅ Use the `Procfile` for startup commands
- ✅ Configure the web service on the assigned port
- ✅ Set up health checks

### Step 5: Monitor Deployment

1. **Check Build Logs:**
   - Railway dashboard shows real-time build progress
   - Watch for any errors during dependency installation
   - Verify gunicorn starts successfully

2. **Test Your Application:**
   - Railway provides a unique `.railway.app` URL
   - Visit the URL to test your ping indexer
   - Test creating campaigns and ping functionality

### Step 6: Set Up Automatic Deployments (Optional)

The included GitHub Actions workflow will:
- Run tests on every push to main/master
- Automatically deploy to Railway
- Verify deployment success

**To enable this:**
1. Go to Railway Dashboard → Settings → Tokens
2. Generate a Railway token
3. Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:
   - `RAILWAY_TOKEN`: Your Railway API token
   - `RAILWAY_SERVICE`: Your service ID

## Project Configuration Files

Your project already includes all necessary Railway configuration:

- ✅ `railway.json` - Railway-specific deployment config
- ✅ `Procfile` - Defines how to start your app
- ✅ `runtime.txt` - Specifies Python version
- ✅ `pyproject.toml` - Dependencies and project info
- ✅ `.github/workflows/deploy-railway.yml` - Auto-deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build Failures:**
   - Check that all dependencies in `pyproject.toml` are compatible
   - Verify Python 3.11 compatibility

2. **App Won't Start:**
   - Ensure `gunicorn` is properly configured in Procfile
   - Check environment variables are set correctly

3. **Database Connections:**
   - Railway provides PostgreSQL databases if needed
   - Update connection strings in environment variables

### Free Trial Limitations:

- **$5 Credit Limit**: Monitor usage in Railway dashboard
- **Sleep After Inactivity**: Free tier apps may sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity
- **Resource Limits**: Limited CPU and memory on free tier

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Test All Features:**
   - Create test campaigns
   - Verify ping services work
   - Check RSS feed generation
   - Test bulk URL uploads

2. **Monitor Performance:**
   - Watch Railway metrics dashboard
   - Check response times and errors
   - Monitor credit usage

3. **Domain Setup (Optional):**
   - Railway allows custom domains
   - Configure HTTPS (automatic with Railway)
